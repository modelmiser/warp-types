# warp-types-sat

A phase-typed CDCL SAT solver in Rust. Built as the SAT core for the
`warp-types-*` verification stack (SMT, BMC, PDR) and as a home for
gradient-based incomplete solving on cardinality-heavy instances.

## What to use this for

**Embedded SMT/BMC/PDR in Rust applications.** The `warp-types-smt`,
`warp-types-bmc`, and `warp-types-pdr` crates stack cleanly on top:
DPLL(T) theory integration via `TheorySolver` (`theory.rs`), incremental
unroll-to-depth BMC, and IC3 with frames and cubes. Everything runs
in-process — no FFI, no subprocess, no serialization at layer boundaries.
If you're building a verification tool in Rust, the end-to-end pipeline
avoids the Z3/CVC5 bindings tax even if the underlying SAT is slower.

**Cardinality-heavy instances via the gradient solver.** `src/gradient.rs`
follows the FastFourierSAT line (Kyrillidis et al.) — gradient-descent
reformulation with clause-weight EMA on violation frequency. `src/gpu_gradient.rs`
puts per-lane loss + butterfly-reduce + ballot on GPU via `warp-types`.
This is where the parent `warp-types` library does load-bearing work: the
reductions must be warp-uniform and the ballot semantics depend on
lane-safety typing. CPU-path `SimWarp` testing validates the algorithm
before real-hardware execution.

**Reading and learning CDCL with legible types.** Watched literals, 1-UIP
with minimization, VSIDS with phase saving, Luby restarts, LBD-based clause
deletion — a clean first-pass CDCL with the phases surfaced in the type
system for auditability. Used as the reference SAT core in Sol (typed
verification front-end).

## What this is NOT trying to be

**Not a general-purpose CDCL competing with Kissat or CaDiCaL.** Those
represent a decade-plus of Armin Biere's surgical tuning — cache-sized
clause headers, multi-tier LBD clause DB, vivification, BVE, failed-literal
probing, chronological backtracking, interleaved inprocessing. We implement
none of those, deliberately. Expect performance roughly in the
`batsat`/`splr` range on random SAT benchmarks — meaningfully slower than
Kissat, and we don't plan to close that gap by grinding on BCP inner loops.
If you need competition-class raw throughput, link against Kissat via FFI;
that's the right tool.

**Not a parallel solver.** `ClauseToken` in `src/clause.rs` is an affine
ownership token designed for a future parallel BCP path. At v0.3.x it is
unused in the main `solve_cdcl_core_inner` loop and appears only in `bcp.rs`
tests and one non-default BCP path. Treat it as reserved infrastructure —
when a parallel BCP path lands, the token will make concurrent
re-acquisition of the same clause a type error. Today it is a runtime
bitset check inside `ClausePool::acquire`.

## The typestate, precisely

The `SolverSession<'s, P>` pattern encodes CDCL phases (`Decide → Propagate
→ Analyze → Backtrack`) as zero-sized types with invariant branded lifetimes
(`with_session(f: for<'s> FnOnce(...))`, `fn(&'s ()) -> &'s ()`). For code
that routes state changes through the session, the phase ordering is
compile-time enforced: you cannot consume a `Propagate` session twice, and
you cannot fabricate a different phase without going back through the
declared transition methods. `solve_cdcl_core_inner` routes everything
through the session, and the control flow is easier to audit as a result.

This is *legible control flow*, not a type-system fortress. A few honest
qualifications:

- `analyze::analyze_conflict` and `trail.backtrack_to` are free functions
  that take no phase proof — callers can invoke them outside the session
  if they choose. Only `bcp::run_bcp` requires a phase witness, and it's
  passed as `_phase_proof: &SolverSession<'_, Propagate>` — a compile-time
  gate, not a runtime check.
- The `'s` brand lifetime prevents nested `with_session` calls from
  unifying their phase proofs. It does not bind the session to the solver
  state; a stronger design would carry `&'s mut SolverState` so BCP
  couldn't accept another solver's phase proof. That's v0.4+ work.

The right mental model is `MutexGuard`: it makes the common safe path
easier to write and audit, and misuse requires deliberately bypassing the
session API. We think that is a useful ergonomic property — especially for
embedding in Rust verification tooling where the call graph is under your
control — but it is narrower than "invalid phase transitions are compile
errors."

## Performance expectations

Benchmarks are scaffolded in `benches/` (criterion) but not yet published.
Tier-1 plan: honest numbers against `batsat` and `splr` on SATLIB uf50/uf75
(Rust-peer solvers, not Kissat) plus a cardinality-heavy suite where the
gradient path should earn its keep. Expect updates.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --bin solve -- problem.cnf
```

Reads DIMACS CNF, prints `s SATISFIABLE` or `s UNSATISFIABLE` with the
variable assignment in standard SAT competition format.

## What's inside

- **Phase types** (`phase.rs`) — zero-sized marker types for CDCL phases,
  with sealed `CanTransition` trait
- **Phase-typed session** (`session.rs`) — `SolverSession<'s, P>` with
  invariant branded lifetimes
- **Affine clause tokens** (`clause.rs`) — non-`Copy`, non-`Clone`
  ownership tokens. Reserved for a future parallel BCP path; not yet used
  in the main solver
- **Tile-local BCP** (`bcp.rs`, `clause_tile.rs`) — watched-literal
  propagation, plus a ballot-based variant that maps to GPU warp operations
- **1-UIP conflict analysis** (`analyze.rs`) — implication graph traversal,
  learned clause derivation with LBD scoring and minimization
- **LBD clause deletion** (`solver.rs`) — learned clauses scored by LBD and
  aged out. Single-pool deletion, not multi-tier
- **Trail** (`trail.rs`) — assignment stack with decision levels and reasons
- **Theory solver** (`theory.rs`) — `TheorySolver` trait for DPLL(T):
  `check`, `backtrack`, `explain`
- **DIMACS parser** (`dimacs.rs`) — full CNF format support
- **Solver** (`solver.rs`) — top-level CDCL loop with `solve_with_theory()`
  for SMT integration
- **Gradient solver** (`gradient.rs`, `gpu_gradient.rs`) — gradient-descent
  reformulation; GPU path via `warp-types` behind `feature = "gpu"`
